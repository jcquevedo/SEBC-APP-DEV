# Day 4: Kafka

Kafka is a messaging technology for Hadoop. A few notes:

<li>Kafka messages are collected into topics</li>
<li>Topics are split into partitions</li>
<li>Partitions can be replicated (typically 3)</li>
<li>Messages can be keyed (key/value pairs) or unkeyed</li>
<li>Consumers of Kafka Topics can be grouped into Consumer Groups, where each consumer in the group is assigned a topic partition</li>
